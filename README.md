# Python-learning
Welcome to my Python Programming course repository! This repository will be a record of my journey through learning Python. It will include my notes, exercises, and projects as I work through the course.

My Goals:
Throughout the course, I aim to:

Build hands-on projects that reinforce the concepts learned.
Gain proficiency in Python programming for real-world applications.
Prepare for advanced Python topics such as machine learning and web development.
